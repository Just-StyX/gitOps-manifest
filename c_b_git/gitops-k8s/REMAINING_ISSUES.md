# Remaining Issues to Address

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Missing Observability Stack Configurations
The following files reference observability services that don't have deployment manifests:
- `grafana-configuration.yml` and `grafana-deployment-service.yml`
- `prometheus-configuration.yml` and `prometheus-deployment-service.yml` 
- `loki-configuration.yml` and `loki-deployment-service.yml`
- `tempo-configuration.yml` and `tempo-deployment-service.yml`
- `otel-collector-configuration.yml` and `otel-collector-deployment-service.yml`
- `jaeger-deployment-service.yml`
- `zipkin-deployment-service.yml`

**Action**: Review and validate these observability stack configurations.

### 2. Service Name Inconsistencies
- ConfigMap references `redis-service` but the actual service should be named `redis-service` (update the fixed Redis deployment)
- Some references to `learning-ui-service` should be `learning-ui`

### 3. Redis Configuration Mismatch
The current `redis-configuration.yml` is for cluster mode but we're using single instance.
**Action**: Update or remove this file since single Redis doesn't need complex configuration.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Resource Management
- Add resource requests and limits to all deployments (partially done in fixed files)
- Add node selectors and affinity rules for production readiness

### 5. Security Enhancements
- Secrets are base64 encoded but use weak passwords
- No network policies defined
- No RBAC configurations
- Consider using external secret management

### 6. Storage Classes
- All PVCs use "standard" storage class - verify this exists in your cluster
- Consider different storage classes for different workloads

### 7. Health Checks
- Add startup probes for slower-starting applications
- Tune probe timing for production workloads

## Low Priority Issues

### 8. Configuration Cleanup
- Many files contain large commented sections that should be removed
- Some environment variables are duplicated or unused

### 9. Monitoring and Alerting
- No monitoring rules or alerts defined
- Missing service monitors for Prometheus

### 10. Backup and DR
- Database backup is configured but not tested
- No disaster recovery procedures documented

## Quick Fixes Applied
✅ Renamed `redi-configuration.yml` to `redis-configuration.yml`
✅ Created missing ConfigMaps for learning-service and learning-ui
✅ Fixed Redis to use single instance instead of cluster
✅ Corrected volume mount paths and environment variables
✅ Added proper health checks and resource limits
✅ Cleaned up deployment files and removed commented code
✅ Created deployment order guide

## Next Steps
1. Test the deployment with the fixed files
2. Address observability stack configurations
3. Implement proper secret management
4. Add network policies and RBAC
5. Performance tune resource allocations
6. Set up monitoring and alerting
